          <p style="text-align: justify">
            Been meaning to tell you how truly grateful I am for everything
            you’ve done for me. All the big things and the little things that
            made my life easier, warmer and more memorable. If I ever did
            anything that hurt you or strained our relationship, I’m really
            sorry. I take full responsibility for it because it's really my
            fault. But still, thank you for staying, for caring about me in ways
            I sometimes felt I didn’t deserve. I do really appreciate your
            kindness and it really mean so much to me. One thing I promise is
            that I won’t take this chance again for granted. I’ll do my very
            best to become a better person for you like someone you can be proud
            of. I’ll always support you, pray for you and stand by your side,
            langga and please remember I will always be here whenever you need
            me. I really appreciate you reaching out to me today and telling me
            you have a visitor. I understand so don’t worry about anything. Just
            enjoy your time, have fun and always take good care of yourself. You
            mean so much to me more than you ever know. I miss you and Aiah a
            little extra today. You really did glow up your attitude hahaha.
            Pinangga kaayo tamong Aiah and Daisy.
